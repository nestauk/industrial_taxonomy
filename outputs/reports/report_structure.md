# A bottom-up industrial taxonomy for the UK: refinements and applications

This is a suggested outline & division of labour for the report.

## Executive summary

## 1. Introduction (JMG)

- Why the taxonomy is important
- What we have done so far
- Areas for improvement
- Areas for application set in the context of the levelling up agenda

## 2. Methodology:

- Summary of approach
- Refinements:
  - Filtering of low silhouette score sectors (JMG)
  - New assignment procedure (GR)
  - Text cluster naming (GR)
  - Hierarchical taxonomy (GR)
- Areas for further work
- Secondary data
  - ONS
  - Nesta / BEIS

## 3. Application 1: Segmenting the UK economy through our text sectors [JMG]

- Consequential benchmarking of taxonomy outputs
  - Compare predictive performance of taxonomies based on different assignment procedures and similarity thresholds
  - Benchmark text sector based and SIC based taxonomy
- Clustering local authorities
- Geography and NUTS content
- Sectoral profiles
- Secondary indicator benchmarking
- Anything else?
  - This doesn't look very policy relevant. Can we e.g. identify high heterogeneity secondary indicators within clusters?

## 3. Application 2: Multi-sector companies.

- Methodology to identify multi-sector companies
- What text-sectors tend to be more "multi-sector"
- Where are they based?
  - Geography and sector clusters
- Anything on digitalisation?
  - Regional differences in sectors with digital capabilities (e.g. secondary text sectors in Information and communication divisions)

## 4. Conclusions and next steps
